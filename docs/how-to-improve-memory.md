# How to improve memory

The assistant's memory compounds on its own as you use it. This is how to make it
sharper, and how to add search-by-meaning.

## The memory you already have

- `memory/MEMORY.md` is a short index, loaded at the start of every session.
- Durable facts live one per file in `memory/topics/`, linked from the index.
- The assistant writes a memory when you tell it to, when the same thing gets
  looked up across sessions, when you correct it, or when a hard problem is
  worth not repeating. See the constitution's Memory System section.

Feed it well: correct mistakes and ask it to remember the correction; run
`/reflect` at the end of a real working session to capture what was learned;
keep `MEMORY.md` short and let detail live in topic files.

## Sharper retrieval: the memory-search module

By default the assistant finds notes with keyword search (`Grep`). That is fine
for a small vault. As `memory/` and `vault/` grow, enable the **memory-search**
module for ranked, and optionally semantic, retrieval.

### Step 1 — build the index

Run the `/index-memory` skill, or:

```bash
python3 modules/memory-search/index.py
```

That builds a keyword index (SQLite FTS5: ranked, stemmed, no setup). The
`second-brain` agent uses it automatically from then on. Re-run it after a burst
of note-taking to keep it current.

### Step 2 — semantic search (optional)

Keyword search still needs the right word. Semantic search finds a note by
*meaning*: ask "what did we decide about pricing" and it finds the note even if
that note never said "pricing".

It needs a local embedding model via [Ollama](https://ollama.com). One time:

```bash
# install Ollama from https://ollama.com, then:
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

Re-run `/index-memory`. It detects Ollama and builds a semantic index instead of
a keyword one. The model runs locally; nothing leaves your machine.

### Doing it proactively

The index is a snapshot, so refresh it. Either re-run `/index-memory` yourself,
or schedule it. A daily cron line:

```text
0 7 * * *  cd /path/to/compabob && python3 modules/memory-search/index.py
```

memory-search stays opt-in and lightweight on purpose: it is a skill you run,
not a daemon the kit forces on you.
