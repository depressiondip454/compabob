# Architecture

How the kit is put together, and the principles behind it. Read this once to understand why things are where they are; you do not need it to use the kit.

## The shape

```
CONSTITUTION.md      The behavior contract. Loaded every session via CLAUDE.md.
.claude/agents/      Specialized agents. The main session routes work to them.
.claude/skills/      Slash-command workflows. Repeatable procedures.
.claude/output-styles/  How responses are shaped (answer-first).
hooks/               Deterministic guards and lifecycle scripts.
memory/              Durable facts, carried across sessions.
vault/               The Obsidian knowledge base.
modules/             Opt-in extensions.
```

## Your data vs the kit

A hard line runs through the directory tree, and it is what makes the kit safe to update:

- **The kit** (version-controlled, updates from upstream): `CONSTITUTION.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/output-styles/`, `hooks/`, `modules/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`, and the `*.example` seeds.
- **Your data** (git-ignored, never touched by an update): `vault/`, `memory/`, `config/`, and `.claude/settings.local.json`. `setup.sh` creates these from the `*.example` seeds on first run.

Kit files contain no personal placeholders. `setup.sh` personalizes only the seed copies. `update.sh` pulls new kit versions and physically cannot reach your data, because your data is not in git. This separation is deliberate: it lets the kit improve over time without ever putting a user's knowledge base at risk.

## Three kinds of thing

The kit separates three concerns. Keeping them distinct is what keeps it coherent as it grows.

- **The constitution and skills** define *what to do*: instructions, procedures, conventions.
- **The agents** do the *intelligent coordination*: they read context, make judgment calls, decide.
- **The hooks** are *deterministic execution*: they always do the same thing, with no judgment. A guard either fires or it does not.

When you add something, ask which of the three it is. A judgment call belongs in an agent. A fixed rule belongs in a hook. A repeatable procedure belongs in a skill.

## Agent routing

There is no manual agent picker. The main session reads each agent's `description` and routes the request to the best match. This is why descriptions matter more than names: the description is the routing signal.

- A good description says *when* to use the agent and what it is *not* for.
- If routing goes wrong, the fix is almost always a sharper description, not new code.
- Agents are scoped: each gets only the tools its job needs. An agent with every tool routes unpredictably.

The main session orchestrates multi-step work: it calls agents, passes their output between them, and synthesizes. Agents produce data; the main session produces the answer. Advice-only agents (`strategy-advisor`, `principal-engineer`, `first-principles`) never write or send; when their output should persist, it goes to `second-brain`.

## The hook lifecycle

Hooks run at fixed points in a session and cannot be talked out of their job by a clever prompt. The kit wires six:

- **SessionStart** → `hook-session-start.sh` injects the memory index and any handover note.
- **UserPromptSubmit** → `hook-inject-now.sh` injects the current time.
- **PreToolUse(Bash)** → `hook-block-dangerous.py` and `hook-comms-guard.py` block destructive commands and un-approved sends.
- **PreToolUse(Read)** → `hook-protect-secrets.py` blocks reading credential files.
- **PostToolUse** → `prompt-injection-defender/` flags injected instructions in tool output.

Hooks fail open: a hook that errors never breaks the session. The guards are defense-in-depth, not the only line of defense.

## Memory

`memory/MEMORY.md` is a short index, loaded every session. Durable facts live one-per-file in `memory/topics/`, linked from the index and read only when relevant. This keeps the always-loaded context small while keeping detail available. The bar for writing a memory is deliberately high (see the constitution): memory is for what the files and git history do not already capture.

## Principles worth keeping

If you extend the kit, these are what keep it sound:

- **Description-driven routing.** Selection is by description, not name. Write descriptions as "use for X, Y, Z".
- **Scoped tools.** Four to six tools per agent. Less is sharper.
- **Strict schemas for deterministic work.** Where a workflow must produce structured output, validate with a schema, not a hope.
- **Draft, never auto-send.** Anything leaving the machine is shown to the human first. The `comms-guard` hook backs this up.
- **Answer first.** Every response leads with the conclusion. See `.claude/output-styles/direct.md`.
- **Honest data labels.** `[ACTUAL]`, `[PROJECTED]`, `[ASSUMPTION]`, `[DATA GAP]`. Never dress an estimate as a measurement.
- **Fail open on guards, fail loud on data.** A broken hook should not break the session; a missing number should never become a guessed one.
