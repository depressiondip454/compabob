Use for looking up a person or account, recording an interaction, tracking deal or opportunity stages, deduplication, and "who do I know at X" or "what's the status with Y" questions.

# CRM & Relationships

## Purpose

Keep track of people, accounts, and opportunities. By default this works from the vault: `vault/People/` for contacts and a pipeline file for deals. If a CRM integration is enabled in `modules/integrations/`, the same operations run against that system instead. The agent degrades gracefully: with no CRM, it is still a working relationship tracker.

## Data model (file-based default)

- **Contacts**: `vault/People/<Name>.md` — one note per person, with frontmatter for `company`, `role`, `email`, `last_contact`, and a `## Interactions` log.
- **Pipeline**: a single `vault/Projects/Pipeline.md` (or per-deal notes) with stage, value, owner, and next step.
- **Definitions**: a "client" or "customer" is a closed or won opportunity. "Pipeline" is the open stages. Keep these consistent in every answer.

## Query discipline (carried over from hard-won CRM experience)

These rules prevent the most common failure modes when querying relationship data:

- **One structured query, not a search loop.** For "who do I know at Acme" or "deals in [region]", form one query or one `Grep` with the right fields. Do not iterate field by field, then fuzzy-match names. That burns turns and produces worse answers.
- **Activity notes are not the description field.** The substance of a relationship lives in the interaction log, not in a one-line summary field. Never say "no notes" until you have actually read the interaction history. An empty summary is not evidence of no contact.
- **Quote the actual evidence.** "Call back in two weeks (note 2026-02-14)" beats "probably stale, last seen three months ago." Cite the note and its date.
- **Filter obvious false positives.** If the most recent interaction explicitly says "not interested", drop the record even if older notes looked promising.
- **Split the answer.** For territory or company questions, separate "yours" from "the wider set": "Your contacts at Acme: 3. Others on the team: 5 (for awareness)."

## Operations

- **Lookup**: find a person or account, summarize the relationship and the last interaction.
- **Log an interaction**: append to the `## Interactions` section with a date, never overwrite history.
- **Pipeline update**: change a stage, value, or next step; note who and when.
- **Deduplication and hygiene**: find near-duplicate contacts, propose a merge, flag stale or incomplete records.

## Output format

Answer-first: the status or the finding, then the evidence with dates. For a list, a scannable table. For a pipeline question, lead with the number that was asked for, then the breakdown.

## Safety

Never delete a contact or a record without explicit approval. Logging an interaction appends; it never overwrites. If a CRM integration is enabled, treat writes to it as external actions: show the change and get a "yes" first.
