# Second Brain

## Purpose

Manage and retrieve knowledge from the Obsidian vault at `vault/`. Synthesize across meeting notes, research, and documentation. Keep summaries concise and action-oriented. The vault is cognitive infrastructure, not documentation: maintaining it well is the job, not a chore around the job.

## Vault structure

- **Front door**: `vault/00-Home.md` — the map of content.
- **People**: `vault/People/<Name>.md` — one note per person, Title Case filename.
- **Meetings**: `vault/Meetings/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` — date-prefixed.
- **Projects**: `vault/Projects/<Project>.md`.
- **Daily notes**: `vault/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.
- **Decisions**: `vault/Decisions/` — written by the `/log-decision` skill.
- **Sources**: `vault/Sources/` — imported or reference material.

Entity lookup order when reading about a person, company, or topic: `People/<Name>.md`, then a top-level `<Name>.md`, then `Grep` across the vault.

## Obsidian formatting

Write notes directly with Write/Edit. Key syntax:

- Wikilinks: `[[Note Name]]` or `[[Note Name|Alias]]`
- Frontmatter: a YAML block with `title:`, `date:`, `tags:`, `aliases:`
- Callouts: `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!TIP]`
- Embeds: `![[Note Name]]`
- Tasks: `- [ ] Task` with optional `[due:: YYYY-MM-DD]`

Every note gets frontmatter. Notes are written in the user's primary language regardless of the source language of the input.

## Capabilities

- **Retrieval**: search notes by filename and content; find meetings by date, person, or topic; cross-reference.
- **Note creation**: meeting notes, person notes, topic notes, research syntheses, all with wikilinks and frontmatter.
- **Synthesis**: summarize meeting threads, extract action items, surface patterns, generate status reports.

## Memory-search index

If `modules/memory-search/generated/index.db` exists, the memory-search module is
enabled. For "what did we discuss / decide about X" retrieval, query it before
falling back to `Grep`: run `python3 modules/memory-search/query.py "<what you are
looking for>"`. It returns the most relevant chunks from `memory/` and `vault/`,
ranked by meaning when the semantic backend is set up, by keyword otherwise. If
the index does not exist, retrieve with `Grep` as usual.

## Routines

| Trigger | Routine |
|---------|---------|
| "daily pulse", "what's my status" | Read today's daily note, overdue and due-today tasks, and (if a calendar integration is enabled) today's meetings. Synthesize priority-first. |
| "weekly review" | Daily pulse plus a week comparison, stale items older than five days, and a sync of the vault. |
| "vault sync" | Discover changed notes, fix broken wikilinks, standardize frontmatter, archive completed tasks older than two weeks. |

## Task intake gate

Before adding a `- [ ]` checkbox anywhere, search existing open tasks for a similar one (three or more overlapping meaningful words). If it is an exact duplicate, skip it. If it is the same project from a new angle, merge it as a sub-bullet. If it is new, add it. Keep one canonical location per task; meeting notes record context, they do not own the task.

## Meeting note growth

After creating a meeting note: run the task intake gate on its action items; if a mentioned person has no note, create a stub; if a mentioned topic has no note, create a stub with frontmatter. Every meeting should grow the vault a little.

## Wikilink hygiene

During a vault sync: `Grep` for `[[` targets in recently modified files, compare against existing filenames and aliases, and for any target with no match either create a stub or add an alias to the closest note. This stops link debt from compounding.

## Output format

Answer-first. For a daily pulse: a status line, then Priorities, Overdue, Calendar, Needs Response. For retrieval: a short executive summary, then supporting detail with source links. Before creating a note, confirm the filename and location.

## Safety

Read-only by default. The only write action is saving notes to the vault. Never overwrite a hand-authored note without showing the diff first. Only access the user's own data.
