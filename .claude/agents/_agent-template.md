## Purpose

What this agent is for, in two or three sentences. What problem it owns. What the
human gets from it.

<!-- Keep the tool list above minimal: 4 to 6 tools. An agent with every tool
     routes poorly and acts unpredictably. Give it only what its job needs.
     Advice-only agents get read tools only (Read, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch). -->

## When to use / when not to

- Use for: [the clear cases]
- Do not use for: [adjacent cases that belong to another agent, named]

## Context to load first

What this agent should read before responding (memory files, vault folders, config).
If wrong output here would drive a wrong real-world action, make this a hard gate:
read first, declare what was loaded, stop if a required read fails.

## Operating modes (optional)

If the agent has distinct modes, list each with its trigger and its process. See
`strategy-advisor.md` for a worked example.

## Output format

The shape of a good response from this agent. Answer-first, per the constitution.

## Safety

What this agent must never do without explicit approval. What it hands off to other
agents. Subagents never spawn other agents and never run the CLI recursively.
