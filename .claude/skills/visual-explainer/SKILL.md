# Visual Explainer

Produce one standalone HTML file that explains something clearly. Good for architecture overviews, plan reviews, before/after comparisons, timelines, and dashboards.

## Steps

1. **Clarify the subject and the audience.** What is being explained, and who reads it? That sets the depth.
2. **Choose the form**: a flow diagram, a comparison table, a timeline, a layered architecture, a metric dashboard.
3. **Build one self-contained `.html` file**:
   - All CSS inline in a `<style>` block. No external stylesheets, no CDN links, no network dependencies. The file must open correctly offline by double-clicking it.
   - Readable typography, generous spacing, a restrained palette.
   - Content-first: the explanation carries the page, decoration supports it.
4. **Save** to `reports/` (create the directory if needed) as `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.html`.
5. **Tell the user** the path so they can open it.

## Principles

- Self-contained or it does not count. One file, opens offline.
- The page answers a question. Lead with that answer, same as any other output.
- Prefer this over a large ASCII table (four or more rows, or three or more columns).
