# Log Decision

Capture a decision while the reasoning is fresh, so it can be reviewed honestly later. The point is calibration: a decision logged with its expected outcome can be checked against what actually happened.

## Steps

1. **Gather** the decision: what was decided, when, and by whom.
2. **Capture the reasoning**: the key factors, and the single most important one.
3. **Capture the alternatives**: what else was on the table, and why it lost. "Do nothing" counts.
4. **State the expected outcome** and a **review date** (usually 30 to 90 days out).
5. **Write** to `vault/Decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`.

## Format

```

title: [decision]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
review_on: YYYY-MM-DD
status: open
tags: [decision]

# [Decision]

**Decision**: [what was decided]

**Why**: [the reasoning, most important factor first]

**Alternatives considered**:
- [option] — rejected because [...]

**Expected outcome**: [what success looks like, concretely]

**Review on <review-date>**: _(left blank until the review)_
```

## Reviewing

When `/log-decision review` is run, list decisions whose `review_on` date has passed, and for each ask: did it work out? Fill in the review section and set `status` to `validated`, `mixed`, or `wrong`. Honest reviews are the whole value.
