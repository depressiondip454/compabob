# Index Memory

Builds the local search index that the memory-search module uses. Run it after a
burst of note-taking, or on a schedule.

## Steps

1. Run the indexer:
   `python3 modules/memory-search/index.py`
2. Report back: how many chunks were indexed, and which backend it used.
   **Semantic** means search-by-meaning (Ollama with an embedding model is
   running). **Keyword** means FTS5 ranked search, the zero-setup default.
3. If it used the keyword backend and the user wants search-by-meaning, point
   them to `docs/how-to-improve-memory.md` for the one-time Ollama setup.

Once the index exists, the `second-brain` agent queries it automatically when
retrieving notes. To keep it current, re-run this skill, or schedule it (see
`modules/memory-search/README.md`).
